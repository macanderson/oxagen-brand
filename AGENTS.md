# AGENTS.md

## Local execution

Mac set this on 2026-09-26 for every repository on this machine. Local builds, test runs, dev servers, and git hooks ran the laptop out of memory and killed agent runs partway through, and every killed run costs money. CI is the only place code is built, checked, or tested.

- Do not run the gate, a build, a typecheck, a lint, or any test, not even one test file. Push the branch and read the CI result. Read a failed job with `gh run view --job <id> --log-failed`.
- Do not start a dev server: no `next dev`, `next start`, `pnpm dev`, a server under `cargo run`, or anything else that listens on a port.
- Do not start Docker or Colima, and do not run anything that needs them.
- Do not run Biome in any form.
- Git hooks are off on this machine. `LEFTHOOK=0` and `HUSKY=0` are set for every shell and every Claude Code session. Do not reinstall a hook, turn one back on, or run a hook's commands by hand.
- Code generators and small integrity scripts that only read and write files are allowed, such as regenerating a checksum, a schema index, or a message catalogue.
- Put this rule, word for word, in the prompt of every subagent you start.

## Issue fields and reflection

Mac set this on 2026-09-28 for every repository. Every issue in Mac's repositories belongs on the `All issues` project board in the `macanderson` account. The board carries six fields. Keep all six correct on every issue you work on.

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt | Text | The prompt that starts an agent on the work |
| Model Tier | Ultra, Pro, Standard, Lite | The model tier the work needs |
| Size | XS, S, M, L, XL | The size of the change |
| `agent_mins_est` | Number | Agent minutes the work should take |
| `agent_mins` | Number | Agent minutes the work took |
| Resolution | Shipped, Won't ship, Duplicate | How the issue closed |

- **Add the issue to the board when you file it.** Set Prompt, Model Tier, and `agent_mins_est` at the same time. Set Size too, unless a triage rule in this repository gives sizing to the triage agent.
- **Stamp your minutes when your run ends.** Add the minutes your run spent on the issue to `agent_mins`. Add to the value already there, because several runs can share one issue.
- **Write a reflection when your run ends.** Post it as a comment on the issue. Give your run's minutes, say what shipped, compare `agent_mins` with `agent_mins_est`, and say what the next agent should know. The reflections are the record of minutes. If two runs write `agent_mins` at once and one value is lost, rebuild the sum from the reflections.
- **Set Resolution when the issue closes.**
- **Fix any field you find wrong** on any issue you touch.
- **Use the reflection until the board exists.** If `gh project list` shows no `All issues` board, or your token lacks the `project` scope, write the six values in the reflection instead. Copy them to the board once it exists.

These commands find the board and set a field:

```sh
gh project list --owner macanderson                                  # the board titled "All issues"
gh project field-list <number> --owner macanderson --format json     # field and option ids
gh project item-add <number> --owner macanderson --url <issue-url> --format json --jq .id   # the item id
gh project item-edit --project-id <project-id> --id <item-id> --field-id <field-id> --number 42
```
