// Moved from oxagen apps/app/src/ui/expiry-clock.ts at ddb85803.
// The clock a row judges its own expiry against.
//
// A page reads its rows once and the instant it read them travels with them, so
// every state derived from that instant is frozen at the render. A credential
// or an enrollment left on screen across its `expiresAt` then keeps saying
// "active" while authentication already refuses it — a claim about authority
// the record does not support.
//
// So a row that still has an expiry ahead of it re-reads the clock until it
// crosses. A row with no expiry, or one already past, sets no timer: there is
// nothing left for it to learn, and a timer per row on a long table is a cost
// paid for nothing.
//
// This is always the courtesy, never the guarantee. The handler judges against
// its own clock and refuses — `packages/auth/src/resolvers/api-key.ts` for a
// key, `packages/handlers/src/lib/tacho-host.ts` for an enrollment — on the API
// and MCP as well as here.
