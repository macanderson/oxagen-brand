// Markdown a third party wrote, rendered as HTML a person can read: a tool's
// description as the provider that published it wrote it. Headings, lists,
// emphasis, and fenced code render. Raw HTML in the source renders as the
// text it was written as, never as markup.
//
// Two reasons for the last rule. The text is untrusted, and a description is
// written for a model, which reads angle brackets as placeholders: Notion's
// `ADD COLUMN "Name" <type>` and `<data-source>` are words in a sentence.
// Streamdown's default sanitizer would delete them as unknown elements and
// leave the sentence missing its nouns.
