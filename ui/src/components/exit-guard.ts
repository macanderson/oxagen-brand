// Moved from oxagen apps/app/src/ui/exit-guard.ts at ddb85803.
// Holding the window while a value exists only on this screen.
//
// A dialog's close paths are its own `onOpenChange`, and a modal dialog's
// backdrop makes the page behind it inert, so the links there cannot be
// clicked while it is open (`@base-ui/react` renders one whenever `modal` is
// set, which is its default). Neither reaches the browser: a refresh, a tab
// closing or a typed address unmounts the island whatever is on screen, and a
// value the server hands back exactly once lives in client state and nowhere
// else, so each of those exits loses it. `beforeunload` puts the browser's own
// "leave site?" prompt in front of all three.
//
// The alternative — writing the value to `localStorage` so it survives a
// reload — is worse than the defect: a secret shown once would then sit in
// browser storage indefinitely, readable by anything with the origin. The
// value stays in memory and the window is held instead.
//
// The guard arms only while something can actually be lost. A prompt that
// fires when there is nothing to lose is one people learn to click through,
// and then it no longer works the one time it matters.
//
// **Back is not held, deliberately.** It is a same-document history
// navigation, so no `beforeunload` runs, and `popstate` fires only after the
// traverse has been committed — too late to render anything. The one way to
// pre-empt it is to push a duplicate history entry for Back to consume, and
// that entry cannot be reclaimed cleanly: the write that ends the risk
// finishes with `router.replace` onto the page it is already on, which
// overwrites the duplicate but leaves the identical entry beneath it, so every
// completed write would add a Back press that appears to do nothing. Taking it
// back with `history.back()` from the effect's cleanup instead races that same
// `router.replace` and can leave the roster showing the pre-write tree. A dead
// Back stop on every successful write is a certain cost against an uncertain
// one, and Back is a deliberate act where a refresh is usually a slip.
