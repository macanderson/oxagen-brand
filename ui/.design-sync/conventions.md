## Building with the Oxagen house system

This is the real `@oxagen/ui` library (Base UI + Tailwind v4, token-driven). It is
the house system for both **oxagen** and **stella** — one palette, one type scale;
the logo is the only difference.

### The rule that will bite you

**`styles.css` is a COMPILED, CLOSED stylesheet — there is no Tailwind runtime here.**
Only the ~597 utility classes the library itself already uses exist. A class you
invent (`bg-sidebar-bg`, `p-12`, `gap-8`) silently does nothing — no error, just
unstyled output.

So: **use library components for UI, and CSS variables for your own layout glue.**

```jsx
<div style={{ background: "var(--card)", color: "var(--card-foreground)",
              border: "1px solid var(--border)", borderRadius: "var(--ui-radius)",
              padding: 24, display: "flex", gap: 16 }}>
```

260 semantic tokens are declared at root scope in `_ds_bundle.css` and **always**
resolve (85 of them are redefined under `.dark`). Each one carries a
`/* @kind color|spacing|radius|shadow|font|other */` marker right after its
declaration — if a custom property has no marker it is Tailwind engine plumbing
(`--tw-*`, utility-scoped), not a token to design with. Families (each `--x` plus often
`--x-foreground`):

- Surfaces: `--background` `--foreground` `--card` `--popover` `--muted` `--surface` `--border` `--ring` `--radius` `--ui-radius`
- Brand/state: `--primary` `--brand` `--destructive` `--success` `--warning` `--error` `--info`
- Per-part: `--button-primary-bg` `--input-border-focus` `--menu-item-highlighted-bg`
  `--dialog-bg` `--tab-fg-active` `--tooltip-bg` `--sidebar-nav-link-active-bg`
  `--card-header-bg` `--control-thumb` `--app-topbar-bg` `--badge-bg` `--link`
- Raw house palette (rarely needed directly): `--ox-gold` `--ox-ink` `--ox-paper` `--ox-panel`

Utility classes that DO exist, if you prefer them: `bg-background` `bg-card`
`bg-muted` `bg-primary` `bg-destructive` `text-foreground` `text-muted-foreground`
`text-primary` `border-border` `border-input` `rounded-sm|md|lg|xl|full`
`shadow-sm|md|lg` `font-sans|display|mono|medium|semibold` `text-xs|sm|lg|xl|2xl`
`gap-1|2|3|4|6`. Anything outside that list: use `var(--token)` instead.

### Theme

`:root` is light; `.dark` on an ancestor flips all 85 themed tokens. Set it with
`<ThemeProvider>` (exported) or put `className="dark"` on a wrapper. Components read
tokens through CSS, so nothing else is needed — never hand-pick a hex.

### Type and the gold rule

Three families, each with its own job. **Space Grotesk** (`--ox-font-display`) sets the
wordmarks and h1 to h3. **Geist** (`--ox-font`) sets h4 to h6 and everything else a
person reads: body, labels, buttons, tables, navigation. **Monaspace Neon**
(`--ox-font-mono`) sets code, terminal output, logs, digests, paths, ids, and numbers
in tables, with `calt` and `liga` on for texture healing. A figure in a table is mono
so columns of digits align.

This paragraph said Space Grotesk was the only family and that mono was the system
stack. That was true of the skin before the house kit, and a generator reading it
would set body copy in the display face and identifiers in whatever the host had.

**Gold (`--ox-gold` / `--primary`) is identity, not state: at most one gold action per
screen, and it never encodes success/failure.** State colors are `--success`
`--warning` `--error` `--info` `--destructive`.

### Where the truth lives

- `_ds_bundle.css` — every token, in the `:root` and `.dark` blocks. Read it before styling.
- `guidelines/THEME.md` — where each kind of answer lives, plus the three rules a token value cannot state (gold is not state; a state's two stops are both marks, so text needs a derived one; both dark blocks state every pair).
- `components/<group>/<Name>/<Name>.prompt.md` and `<Name>.d.ts` — per-component API and examples.

### Idiomatic example

```jsx
const { Panel, Button, Badge } = window.OxagenUI;

<Panel style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column", gap: 16, padding: 24 }}>
  <div style={{ display: "flex", alignItems: "center", gap: 8 }}>
    <h2 style={{ font: "600 18px/1.12 var(--font-display)", margin: 0 }}>Fleet</h2>
    <Badge variant="secondary">12 agents</Badge>
  </div>
  <p style={{ color: "var(--muted-foreground)", margin: 0 }}>
    Every run is governed and evidenced.
  </p>
  <Button variant="primary">Register agent</Button>
</Panel>
```
